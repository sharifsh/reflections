How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier than doing it manually. I like the windows version where it list the file name and then change. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I will learn from mistakes and revert mistakes when needed. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually helps you save time when you have to go back and review, because you save it only when you make major changes. The donwside you might forget to save. Google saves it at a random times and selecting to what time to restore is a time consuming process. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In programming you might have to save multiple files at the same time to make the program work correctly. It is very helpfull and time saving feature. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Lets see how git log command works first 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Yes, definatelly will make me braver. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Let's get started. :)
